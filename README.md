Find Instagram pictures, from Foursquare locations around you.

Context
---------
This is an assignment for an RMIT project.
The subject was :
> Do whatever you want, as long as :
> + it parses data obtained through a JSON Api using NSJSONSerialization
> + uses a UINavigationController, and you can go deep one level, and come back
> + uses an UITableView

(Yes, I might be simplifying a little)


Project
---------
So I came up with this idea (clearly based on [Worldc.am](http://worldc.am/)) :
You just go in the application, search for places around you (using Foursquare's database), and once oyu picked it up, it searches for public Instragram pictures taken there.

That's it.
Have fun !
